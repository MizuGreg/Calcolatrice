# Calcolatrice (Py/Kv)
A (supposedly) simple Python project for a scientific calculator, made with the Kivy graphic framework.

## So... what is it even for?
I decided to update (and hopefully finish) this project on GitHub to become more acquainted with the platform. Besides, I don't really need a calculator. This is why this one is going to be fairly complex so as to give the entire project a meaning, rather than just being a personal coding exercise.

## Structure of the project
The .py file is the Python script, while the .kv file is the Kivy graphic structure. That's all that there is to it. I might think about exporting and isolating the portion of the code that computes a given string, once I've tested it and proved it to be fully functional.
